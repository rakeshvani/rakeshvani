### Hi there 👋

# Rakesh Ranjan

I'm an AI Engineer with a strong passion for building intelligent systems, solving large-scale real-world problems, and exploring the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and distributed systems. I've around 4 years of industry experience working on real-time multimedia and computer vision systems on embedded platforms.

In my current role, I design and deploy multi-camera, real-time video analytics pipelines using GStreamer/DeepStream-based frameworks, handling RTSP ingestion, frame preprocessing, inference, and optimized deployment on embedded Linux devices like NVIDIA Jetson.

I’ve worked on image processing and computer vision algorithms, including image classification, object detection, face recognition, and OCR, and I focus strongly on system-level performance optimization, such as reducing end-to-end latency, improving throughput, and minimizing memory movement using optimized inference runtimes and hardware accelerators.

My experience involves taking vision-based multimedia systems from R&D to production while operating under real-time, power, and hardware constraints. 
 <!-- which closely aligns with this role at Qualcomm.-->
